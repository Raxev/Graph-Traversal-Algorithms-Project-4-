# Graph Traversal Algorithms 
## Depth-First, Breadth-First, Minimum Spanning Tree, Shortest Path - Project 4
Object-oriented program that maps out 52 NC cities with roads that connect them and the distances between the cities along the road. Uses four graph traversal algorithms, depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning tree and shortest path.
